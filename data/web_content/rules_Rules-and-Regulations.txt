The first sentence of a paragraph must be independent (able to stand on its own). For example consider “While these studies are important, there is...” This sentence would be correct in the middle of a paragraph, but as the first sentence, it should more appropriately read, “While studies of the effects of whatever on whatever else are important, there is...”
Try not to use slang.
Do not use contractions. For instance, instead of it's, use it is.
If you are doubtful about the spelling of a word, do not guess. Look up the correct spelling in an appropriate
reference source
Proofread the copy that you submit and do correct minor typographical errors, formatting, spelling, or even the wording, with a pencil. These corrections are inevitable and will communicate that you are serious about your work.
Avoid excessive use of the terms I, me, and my, as well as the phrase personally speaking...
Avoid the use of sexist language. For example, consistently referring to a person as a him or he when it is just as likely for the person to be a she or a her, is sexist. However, using (s)he or him/her all of the time can also be awkward. If you phrase it right, you can often use the word person instead.
Avoid using 'empty words' or words which serve no purpose. For example, In the Smith (1990) study it was found that... should read more like Smith (1990) found that...
Generally speaking, use past tense in the abstract, introduction, and method. Results and discussion sections can be in the present tense.
Abbreviations
When abbreviating any terms, spell them out the first time (in both the abstract and again in the body of the manuscript, if need be). For example, The Sexual Opinion Survey (SOS) was used to...
Do not use too many abbreviations. Whereas one, two, or three can be helpful, four or five can be confusing.
You will often see the following Latin abbreviations used:
cf.
Compare
etc.
and so forth
e.g.,
for example
i.e.,
that is
et al.
and others
vs.
versus, against
Note that (except for et al.) these abbreviations are only used in parenthetic material. In non-parenthetic material, use the English translation.
Do not use E and S as abbreviations for experimenter and subject. This was done in articles written many years ago.
Note the period is not used with the following common abbreviations.
Centimeter
seconds
Milligrams
min
minutes
Grams
hours
Mean
intelligence
Numbers
The numbers zero through nine are spelled out (except when it is a table or figure number, or a metric measurement, etc.). The numbers 10 and above are written as numbers.
Capitalize nouns followed by numerals or letters that denote a specific place in a numbered series. For example, As can be seen in Figure 3, during Block 4 of Session 2 such and such occurred... Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2.
In the abstract, use digits for all numbers except when they begin a sentence. Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2.
Spell out any number when it is the first thing in a sentence. For example, the sentence “34 students were used”, is not appropriate and should read “Thirty-four students were used”.
Try to be consistent with number formats. That is, if you are reporting a series of related numbers, they should all be presented with the same number of decimal places. For an example, see I.D.5 above.
Report only two digits after the decimal point except when you are reporting the exact value of p, where three digits after the decimal point should be reported.
Do not use “0” prior to the decimal point in a coefficient (e.g., correlations coefficients, alpha coefficients etc.).
Citations in the Text
If you use someone's words or ideas, you must give them credit with a citation. This is particularly important, since the penalties for plagiarism are severe.
There are numerous ways to formally cite a reference in the text. Examples include Some fact (last name, year)., Last name (year) noted that..., or In <year>, <last name> reported that... For more ideas, pay close attention to the articles you read.
The first time the reference is cited in the text, spell out all of the authors’ last names. For example, Miller, Rosellini, and Seligman (1975) suggested that... With articles that have three or more authors use the Latin abbreviation for "and others" when the reference is cited a second (or third) time. For example, Miller et al. (1975) suggested that... or ... some fact (Miller et al., 1975).
If the citation is in parentheses and you need to use the word "and", use the ampersand ('&') instead. For example, Some (e.g., Estes & Skinner, 1940) have suggested that..., as compared to Estes and Skinner (1940) have suggested... Note also that the opposite applies as well, that is, if the citation is not in parentheses, you must use the word "and".
Multiple citations in parentheses are placed alphabetically and are separated by a semicolon and a space. For example, Some fact (Carlson, 1972; Moon, 1968; Partin, 1980).
If you cite something second hand, you must make it clear (e.g., Some fact (Smith, as cited in Jones, Year)). Note that in this example, only the Jones reference would be placed in the reference section.
Quotations
You must give page numbers for direct quotes. For example, Smith (1978) noted that "the world is round" (p. 1).
Three or four quotes in a 10 page paper is about the upper limit.
Display a quotation of more than 40 words as free-standing block of text indented 5 spaces from the left margin (doubles spaced as usual). Omit the quotation marks and include the page number in parentheses after the last period. Also, if the quotation is more than one paragraph, indent the first line of the second and any additional paragraphs 5 spaces.
Capitalization
Capitalize formal names of tests (Stroop Color-Word Interference Test).
Capitalize major words and all other words of four letters or more, in headings, titles, and subtitles outside reference lists, for example, "A Study of No-Win Strategies."
Capitalize names of conditions, groups, effects, and variables only when definite and specific. (Group A was the control group; an Age x Weight interaction showed lower weight with age.)
Do not capitalize names of laws, theories, and hypotheses (the law of effect).
Do not capitalize when referring to generalities (any department, any introductory course).
Commas
Do not use commas to separate parts of measurement (9 lbs 5 oz). Use the metric system, as a rule.
Use commas before "and" in lists, for example, height, width, and depth.
Use commas between groups of three digits, for example, 1,453.
Use commas to set off a reference in a parenthetical comment (Patrick, 1993).
Use commas for seriation within a paragraph or sentence. For example, "three choices are (a) true, (b) false, and (c) don't know." Use semicolons for seriation if there are commas within the items. For example, (a) here, in the middle of the item, there are commas; (b) here there are not; (c) so we use semicolons throughout.
Use commas in exact dates, for example, April 18, 1992 (but not in April 1992).
Italics & Underlining
Do not italicize or underline common foreign abbreviations (vice versa, et al., a priori).
Do not italicize or underline for mere emphasis.
Italicize or underline the titles of books and articles, species names, introduction of new terms and labels (the first time only), words and phrases used as linguistic examples, letters used as statistical symbols, and volume numbers in reference lists.
Miscellaneous: Colons, Dashes, Parentheses, Numbering Paragraphs
Do not use "and/or." Write things out. For example, "Monday, Tuesday, or both" is preferable to "Monday and/or Tuesday."
Do not use a colon or other punctuation after an introduction which is not a complete sentence such as this one, or any other sentence in the body of text which flows into an extended quote. The quote "picks up where the sentence leaves off" and provides the punctuation.
Use a dash (rendered on typewriters and some word processors as a double hyphen) when there is a sudden interruption like this one--zoiks!--in the flow of a sentence. Overuse "weakens the flow of the writing" (APA, 2001, p. 81).
Use parentheses to introduce an abbreviation, for example, the galvanic skin response (GSR).
Use appendixes (appendices) as the plural of appendix. Use datum as singular, data as plural. Use matrix as singular, matrices as plural. Phenomenon is the singular form of the plural phenomena. Use schema as singular, schemas (not schemata) as plural.
Headings
APA specifies 5 levels of headings.
Use level 1 heading (centered uppercase and lower case heading) for the subtitles of chapters.
Use flush left bold uppercase and lower case heading for sections of each chapter.
Use flush left bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subsections of a section.
Use indented bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subheadings in each subsection.
Tables and Figures
Tables and figures should be able to stand alone (i.e., you should not have to read the manuscript to be able to understand a table or figure). A big help in this regard is the table title or the figure caption. Use these wisely to explain what is going on in the table or figure. In other words, do not be afraid to be a little bit verbose in your table titles and figure captions.
Tables and figures should not duplicate the same information. Likewise, you should not repeat the data point values in a table or figure in the text of the manuscript.
Tables and figures are most often used to present results, but may also be used to present other information, such as the design or a theoretical schema.
If you include a table or figure, you must introduce it in the text of the results section (e.g., Table 1 displays the...) and describe to the reader what should be seen in it.
Tables
Note that APA style tables do not contain any vertical lines, so do not draw them in or use your word processor to generate them.
Type the table number in bold face and then (on the next line) type the italicized table title flush left. Note that there are no periods used after the table number or title.
There are different ways to format tables. Your best bet is to set the tabs for the table or to use your word processor's table generating ability.
When using columns with decimal numbers, make the decimal points line up.
Line space within the tables should be set at 2 points (see Appendix B for sample tables).
Figures
'Figures' is the technical term for graphs, charts, drawings and pictures.
Figures (other than pictures) may be drawn in black and white only (using a ruler and preferably on graph paper) or they may be generated with a computer graphics program (keeping it in two dimensions).
Each figure should be followed by figure caption. The word 'figure' and the number are italicized, for example, Figure 1. The effects of...
Center each figure on the page vertically as well as horizontally and arrange for the figure to use the bulk of the page.
