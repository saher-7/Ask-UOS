Writing Style 1.1 Your draft must be typed or printed on a computer. 1.2 Set the word processor to one and a half space (1.5 line space) and keep it there throughout the entire draft.* 1.3 Use 8O g white A4 (8.27‖ x 11.69‖) paper. Set h eader and footer at O.5‖ throughout your draft. 1.4 Use one inch margins on the left, right, top, and bottom of the page. These margins are wide in order to leave room for reviewer's comments. 1.5 Set the gutter position on the left of your whole document at.5‖. 1.6 Use 12 points before and after paragraph spacing in which the first line of each paragraph is indented five characters for all paragraphs in the manuscript except the titles, table titles, notes, and figure captions. 1.7 For chapter titles, use 12 points befo re and 36 points after paragraph spacing, whereas in table titles, notes, and figure captions use normal paragraph (O before and after paragraph spacing). 1.8 Use a 12 point font. In other words, there should be 1O typed characters per inch. The whole thesis s hould be typed in Times New Roman only.* 1.9 The font size of chapter titles should be 14, whereas in the title pages, the title of the research may be of 16 point, the remaining (author, institute/department, university, degree requirements) should be of 12 points. All the contents of the first title page should be typed capital, whereas on the second title page, except for the phrase ―In partial fulfillment of the requirement for the‖ all the contents should also be typed in capitals.* 1.1O Single space after se ntence terminators (i.e., '.', '?', '!'). 1.11 Capitalize the first letter following a colon if the clause following the colon is a complete sentence. 1.12 Make sure the text is justified. 1.13 Use chapter separators. Each separator should have chapter titles in bold f ace, in a font size of 2O points, at the center of the page. 2. Writing in General 2.1 You must use complete sentences.

--- PAGE 16 ---

Postgraduate Rules & Regulations -2O2O UNIVERSITY OF SARGODHA Page 16 of 2O 2.2 The first sentence of a paragraph must be independent (able to stand on its own). For example consider ― While these studies are important, ther e is...‖ This sentence would be correct in the middle of a paragraph, but as the first sentence, it should more appropriately read, ―While studies of the effects of whatever on whatever else are important, there is...‖ 2.3 Try not to use slang. 2.4 Do not use co ntractions. For instance, instead of it's, use it is. 2.5 If you are doubtful about the spelling of a word, do not guess. Look up the correct spelling in an appropriate reference source. 2.6 Proofrea d the copy that you submit and do correct minor typographical errors, formatting, spelling, or even the wording, with a pencil. These corrections are inevitable and will communicate that you are serious about your work. 2.7 Avoid excessive use of the terms I, me, and my, as well as the phrase personally speaking... 2.8 Avoid the use of sexist language. For example, consistently referring to a person as a him or he when it is just as likely for the person to be a she or a her, is sexist. However, using (s)he or him /her all of the time can also be awkward. If you phrase it right, you can often use the word person instead. 2.9 Avoid using 'empty words' or words which serve no purpose. For example, In the Smith (199O) study it was found that... should read more like Smith (199O) found that... 2.1O Generally speaking, use past tense in the abstract, introduction, and method. Results and discussion sections can be in the present tense. 3 Abbreviations 3.1 When abbreviating any terms, spell them out the first time (in both the abstract and again in the body of the manuscript, if need be). For example, The Sexual Opinion Survey (SOS) was used to... 3.2 Do not use too many abbreviations. Whereas one, two, or three can be helpful, four or five can be confusing. 3.3 You will often see the followin g Latin abbreviations used: cf. Compare etc. and so forth e.g., for example i.e., that is et al. and others vs. versus, against 3.4 Note that (except for et al.) these abbreviations are only used in parenthetic material. In non -parenthetic material, use th e English translation. 3.5 Do not use E and S as abbreviations for experimenter and subject. This was done in articles written many years ago. 3.6 Note the period is not used with the following common abbreviations. Cm Centimeter s seconds Mg Milligrams min minut es G Grams hr hours M Mean IQ intelligence 4 Numbers 4.1 The numbers zero through nine are spelled out (except when it is a table or figure number, or a metric measurement, etc.). The numbers 1O and above are written as numbers. 4.2 Capitalize nouns followed by n umerals or letters that denote a specific place in a numbered series. For example, As can be seen in Figure 3, during Block 4 of Session

--- PAGE 17 ---

Postgraduate Rules & Regulations -2O2O UNIVERSITY OF SARGODHA Page 17 of 2O 2 such and such occurred... Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2. 4.3 In the abstract, use digits for all numbers except when they begin a sentence. Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2. 4.4 Spell out any number when it is the first thing in a sentence. For example, the sentence ―34 st udents were used‖, is not appropriate and should read ―Thirty -four students were used‖. 4.5 Try to be consistent with number formats. That is, if you are reporting a series of related numbers, they should all be presented with the same number of decimal places. For an example, see I.D.5 above. 4.6 Report only two digits after the decimal point except when you are reporting the exact value of p, where three digits after the decimal point should be reported. 4.7 Do not use ―O‖ prior to the decimal point in a coefficient (e.g., correlations coefficients, alpha coefficients etc.). 5 Citations in the Text 5.1 If you use someone's words or ideas, you must give them credit with a citation. This is particularly important, since the penalties for plagiarism are severe. 5.2 There are nume rous ways to formally cite a reference in the text. Examples include Some fact (last name, year)., Last name (year) noted that..., or In <year>, <last name> reported that... For more ideas, pay close attention to the articles you read. 5.3 The first time the r eference is cited in the text, spell out all of the authors’ last names. For example, Miller, Rosellini, and Seligman (1975) suggested that... With articles that have three or more authors use the Latin abbreviation for "and others" when the reference is c ited a second (or third) time. For example, Miller et al. (1975) suggested that... or... some fact (Miller et al., 1975). 5.4 If the citation is in parentheses and you need to use the word "and", use the ampersand ('&') instead. For example, Some (e.g., Estes & Skinner, 194O) have suggested that..., as compared to Estes and Skinner (194O) have suggested... Note also that the opposite applies as well, that is, if the citation is not in parentheses, you must use the word "and". 5.5 Multiple citations in parentheses are placed alphabetically and are separated by a semicolon and a space. For example, Some fact (Carlson, 1972; Moon, 1968; Partin, 198O). 5.6 If you cite something second hand, you must make it clear (e.g., Some fact (Smith, as cited in Jones, Year)). Note tha t in this example, only the Jones reference would be placed in the reference section. 6 Quotations 6.1 You must give page numbers for direct quotes. For example, Smith (1978) noted that "the world is round" (p. 1). 6.2 Three or four quotes in a 1O page paper is abo ut the upper limit. 6.3 Display a quotation of more than 4O words as free -standing block of text indented 5 spaces from the left margin (doubles spaced as usual). Omit the quotation marks and include the page number in parentheses after the last period. Also, if the quotation is more than one paragraph, indent the first line of the second and any additional paragraphs 5 spaces. 7 Capitalization 7.1 Capitalize formal names of tests (Stroop Color -Word Interference Test). 7.2 Capitalize major words and all other words of four letters or more, in headings, titles, and subtitles outside reference lists, for example, "A Study of No -Win Strategies."

--- PAGE 18 ---

Postgraduate Rules & Regulations -2O2O UNIVERSITY OF SARGODHA Page 18 of 2O 7.3 Capitalize names of conditions, groups, effects, and variables only when definite and specific. (Group A was the control group; an Age x Weight interaction showed lower weight with age.) 7.4 Do not capitalize names of laws, theories, and hypotheses (the law of effect). 7.5 Do not capitalize when referring to generalities (any department, any introductory course). 8 Commas 8.1 Do not use commas to separate parts of measurement (9 lbs 5 oz). Use the metric system, as a rule. 8.2 Use commas before "and" in lists, for example, height, width, and depth. 8.3 Use commas between groups of three digits, for example, 1,453. 8.4 Use commas to set off a reference i n a parenthetical comment (Patrick, 1993). 8.5 Use commas for seriation within a paragraph or sentence. For example, "three choices are (a) true, (b) false, and (c) don't know." Use semicolons for seriation if there are commas within the items. For example, ( a) here, in the middle of the item, there are commas; (b) here there are not; (c) so we use semicolons throughout. 8.6 Use commas in exact dates, for example, April 18, 1992 (but not in April 1992). 9 Italics & Underlining 9.1 Do not italicize or underline common fo reign abbreviations (vice versa, et al., a priori). 9.2 Do not italicize or underline for mere emphasis. 9.3 Italicize or underline the titles of books and articles, species names, introduction of new terms and labels (the first time only), words and phrases use d as linguistic examples, letters used as statistical symbols, and volume numbers in reference lists. 1O Miscellaneous: Colons, Dashes, Parentheses, Numbering Paragraphs 1O.1 Do not use "and/or." Write things out. For example, "Monday, Tuesday, or both" is prefera ble to "Monday and/or Tuesday." 1O.2 Do not use a colon or other punctuation after an introduction which is not a complete sentence such as this one, or any other sentence in the body of text which flows into an extended quote. The quote "picks up where the se ntence leaves off" and provides the punctuation. 1O.3 Use a dash (rendered on typewriters and some word processors as a double hyphen) when there is a sudden interruption like this one --zoiks! --in the flow of a sentence. Overuse "weakens the flow of the writing " (APA, 2OO1, p. 81). 1O.4 Use parentheses to introduce an abbreviation, for example, the galvanic skin response (GSR). 1O.5 Use appendixes (appendices) as the plural of appendix. Use datum as singular, data as plural. Use matrix as singular, matrices as plural. P henomenon is the singular form of the plural phenomena. Use schema as singular, schemas (not schemata) as plural. 11 Headings 11.1 APA specifies 5 levels of headings. 11.2 Use level 5 heading (centered uppercase heading) for research title and chapter titles. 11.3 Use level 1 heading (centered uppercase and lower case heading) for the subtitles of chapters. 11.4 Use flush left bold uppercase and lower case heading for sections of each chapter. 11.5 Use flush left bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subsec tions of a section.

--- PAGE 19 ---

Postgraduate Rules & Regulations -2O2O UNIVERSITY OF SARGODHA Page 19 of 2O 11.6 Use indented bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subheadings in each subsection. 12 Tables and Figures 12.1 Tables and figures should be able to stand alone (i.e., you should not have to read the manuscript to be able to un derstand a table or figure). A big help in this regard is the table title or the figure caption. Use these wisely to explain what is going on in the table or figure. In other words, do not be afraid to be a little bit verbose in your table titles and figur e captions. 12.2 Tables and figures should not duplicate the same information. Likewise, you should not repeat the data point values in a table or figure in the text of the manuscript. 12.3 Tables and figures are most often used to present results, but may also be used to present other information, such as the design or a theoretical schema. 12.4 If you include a table or figure, you must introduce it in the text of the results section (e.g., Table 1 displays the...) and describe to the reader what should be seen in it. 12.5 Tables 12.5.1 Note that APA style tables do not contain any vertical lines, so do not draw them in or use your word processor to generate them. 12.5.2 Type the table number in bold face and then (on the next line) type the italicized table title flush left. Note tha t there are no periods used after the table number or title. 12.5.3 There are different ways to format tables.

ADMISSIONS -RELATED MATTERS 4.1. Application Process: Before applying for admission, students with disabilities should be encouraged to visit the HEI and the HEI’s website to assess the suitability of the premises and its surroundings. The HEI shall ensure that applicants have full information about the supp ort available and can request additional accommodations as needed. The following are the details of the process that must be followed with respect to HEI admissions: a. Admission application forms will include a section where students can convey informatio n on their disability. In certain circumstances, such as to avail the accommodations under Section 4.2 of this policy, applicants shall be required to provide attested copies of a Disability Certificate (as defined in Section 2.3 of this policy). The admis sion application form shall also include a questionnaire for students with disabilities to explain their need for accommodations related to any entrance exams. Moreover, the universities shall take steps to improve accessibility of the admission forms / pr ospectus and all other additional details that might be required or useful for students with disabilities in the manner that accommodate the needs of the different disabilities. b. It is important to note that there shall not be any adverse impact on the a pplication of a prospective student based on his or her disclosure of a disability. The application will be processed in the same manner as other applications, without any discrimination on the basis of the disclosed disability. c. Applicants will be made aware that if they disclose their disability, the information provided on their application will, subject to applicable legislation, be retained on the HEI’s confidential records and made available to relevant individuals involved in the admissions process and the members of the Accessibility Committee, which will provide necessary support during the application, interview, and entrance test process for students with disabilities.

--- PAGE 8 ---

7 I P a g e d. Applicants who have declared a disability on their application form will b e consulted about their needs and given advice on how the HEI will accommodate their needs. e. The HEI shall provide contact details for the Disability Coordinators and information on facilities available for students with disabilities on their prospectus, website, and advertisement for admission. f. In case, the HEI does not have appropriate facilities to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities to study at their institution on legitimate grounds, and the student has otherwise been deemed eligible to be admitted to the university in terms of the admission criteria, the Accessibility Committee shall report the matter to the Vice Chancellor/Rector of the institution and the HEI shall make necessary arrangements to provide the opportuni ty for the student to undertake the program of study at the HEI. g. Upon admission, students with disabilities will be offered an opportunity to provide additional information and documentation about their accessibility needs. 4.2. Entrance exam: Several HEIs require applicants to take an entrance exam. Any such exam must conform to the following requirements: a. Students with disabilities must be able to request special arrangements for entrance tests or interviews as per their needs, subject to the requirements of Section 4.1(a). b. The HEI will ensure the provision of reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities depending on the type of their disability and need during their entrance exam. For example, students with visual impairment may be provided modified exam materials such as Braille papers (Grade 1/un -contracted or Grade 2/contracted), large print exams: either A4 size (18pt bold font) or A3 size (15.5pt font). Students with hearing impairments may be provided special materials or lip -reading test. Depending on the type of disability, including learning disabilities, arrangements such as the following may be made: extra time (25 -1OO per cent extra time depending on the student’s need), supervised breaks during the examination, u se of a computer, use of an amanuensis, use of a reader or a scribe, option for an oral exam, separate invigilation, or a private area to take tests.

--- PAGE 9 ---

8 I P a g e c. In some cases, students with disabilities may be exempted from a part of an examination because of a disability. The HEI may decide to use an alternate assessment tool to ascertain suitability of the student for the degree program. This will be decided by the Academic Council of the HEI. d. Students with disabilities must be informed well in advance about the arrangements being provided for them to undertake the entrance exam. e. In case the entrance exam is administered by a third party, if the designated test administrator does not provide appropriate facilities for students with disabilities to suitably take the test, the HEI will arrange for an alternate entrance exam for students with disabilities. 4.3. Financial aid, quotas, and age relaxation requirements: People with disabilities may qualify for several benefits including those presented below: a. Students with disabilities may qualify for certain benefits under the provisions of the applicable disability laws of the jurisdiction in which they are located. The HEI shall ensure the provision of such benefits in accordance with relevant legislation. I n the absence of, or in addition to, any such benefits, the HEI shall adopt a needs -based system to facilitate students with disabilities whose financial situation may not otherwise permit them to afford their educational and any additional expenses relate d to their needs. The need basis of students with disabilities shall be determined in accordance with the criteria applicable in any government program prescribed for needy students. Presently, the benchmark laid down in Ehsaas Undergraduate Scholarship Pr ogram may be used as standard. For all needy students, all institutional charges including tuition fee, hostel fee and utility charges shall be waived, to the extent not covered from any other scholarship / support program. The website and prospectus for t he HEI will clearly mention any available fee waivers and concessions. b. Students with disabilities may qualify for age relaxation in admission requirements and disability quotas under applicable legislation, and the HEI shall ensure compliance in accorda nce with relevant legislation. The HEI’s website and prospectus will clearly mention any designated quota for persons with disabilities and any age relaxation options. c. Reservation of at least one seat for higher qualification i.e. MS/MPhil and PhD for students with disabilities in all public sector universities / institutions d. Age relaxation up to ten years for admission to all educational programs.

9 I P a g e 5. PROCESS FOR REQUESTING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 5.1. The HEIs shall provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities whenever necessary to encourage their participation in higher education including in classrooms, libraries, laboratories, cafeterias and sports centers. The website of the HEI and other web - based services such as student portals, LMS etc. shall accordingly conform to level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 5.2. It is important to note that the duty of HEIs to provide support and necessary accommodations to students wit h disabilities is an anticipatory duty. In other words, the HEIs should have preparedness to offer reasonable accommodations to students and should not wait to initiate action until requested. 5.3. All students will be informed about options to request reasonable accommodations commensurate with their need during the orientation session. Students with disabilities will be offered an assessment of their study and support needs at the earliest opportunity, preferably before they enroll, or shortly after th e commencement of their program. As evidence of their disability for the purposes of this assessment, the Accessibility Committee may rely on a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner, documenting the disability and the need for any acco mmodations. 5.4. At the commencement of each course, staff * shall also clearly inform the students that any student who, because of a disability, may require special accommodations in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor o r the Disability Coordinators as soon as possible so that requisite arrangements can be made. Faculty are encouraged to use textbooks that are available in alternate format. It may not be necessary to rewrite a course to accommodate students with disabilit ies; simply modifying the presentation of materials may make it fully accessible. 5.5. It is important to note that in making its assessment, the Accessibility Committee will strive to understand and recommend reasonable accommodations specifically focusi ng on the needs of the individual student rather than recommending generic accommodations that may apply to a certain category a disability. Once an assessment has been conducted, the Accessibility Committee shall forward its directions to the relevant imp lementing authority, provided that in case of any accommodations that are directly related to examinations and assessments (i.e. listed under Section 6.2), approval of the competent authority designated by the HEI shall be required before implementation.

--- PAGE 11 ---

1O I P a g e 5.6. The views of the student with disabilities will be taken into consideration at all times during the assessment of their n eeds. The assessment report, containing detailed recommendations, will be shared with the student prior to its implementation. 5.7. Alternatively, the class instructor, the Disability Coordinators and the student may mutually discuss and decide on any s pecial requirements needed (including those needed for mid - term or final examinations) and accommodations at the start of the course and share them with the Accessibility Committee if its support is needed. 5.8. These accommodations may take considerab le time, and students should be informed of their course requirements, course components and reading materials well before the commencement of a course and on their accessibility requirements at the start of the course. 5.9. The Accessibility Committee will monitor the implementation of any accommodations deemed necessary and reasonable. 5.1O. The University will ensure the provision of the same level of services and support to students who acquire any disability (or become aware of their disability) during the course of their study. Every reasonable opportunity will be provided to them to compl ete their studies successfully. 5.11. Clause deleted**. 5.12. Faculty and staff should be aware of the use of accommodations and learning aides for students with disabilities. 5.13. HEIs shall have training programs to train faculty, staff, and memb ers of the accessibility committee on best practices for accommodating students with disabilities and especially encourage its staff, faculty, and students to participate in development opportunities related to the provision of education to persons with di sabilities. 5.14. Students with disabilities shall be encouraged to suggest improvements in accessibility and accommodation services available at the HEI. If one student with a particular type of disability had difficulty with a specific task, the faculty, the Accessibility Committee, and the Disability Coordinators may not assume that the next student with the same type of disability will experience similar problems. Students with disabilities are frequently sensitive about their disabilities, so faculty, the Disability Coo rdinators and staff should make every effort to treat these issues sensitively and confidentially.

--- PAGE 12 ---

11 I P a g e 6. TYPES OF ACCOMMODATIONS 6.1. Reasonable accommodations. In determining the accommodations to be provided, the Accessibility Committee shall make sure that these are reasonably tied to the nature and extent of the disability suffered. It is important to remember that accommodations are not advantages, but are a means of providing each student w ith full access to study programs. Depending on the case, accommodations may include: a. medical and mental health assistance such as access to counselling; b. changes to physical infrastructure of HEIs including addition of footpaths, road crossings, sign age etc., provision of ramps or special pathways, wheel chairs, furniture, boards, dedicated washrooms and other basic facilities retrofitting in the existing buildings and to ensure the same in future construction; c. Provision of free transport service w ithin the campus for students with disabilities in particular; d. human, digital and assistive technology support including (but not limited to) readings, lecture tape recordings, audiotaped or Brailled handouts, laptops or high -tech computers capable of r unning heavy screen reading, optical character readers, Braille displays, and other special software, Braille embossers, books, and magazines, Braille lab signs and equipment for students with visual impairments, lecture notes, headphones and induction, as sistive hearing devices, video cameras, recordings and video conferencing, for students with auditory impairments, wheelchair assistance, lecture notes, scribes for students with ambulatory difficulties, scanners and printers, special books/tutorials inclu ding large print versions, e -books or audio books, media with closed captioning, and wheelchair assistance; e. additional time, explanation and quiet areas; and f. any other accommodation as may be necessary as determined by the Accessibility Committee from time to time, provided that any such accommodations that are directly related to examinations and assessments, such as those under Section 6.2, shall require the student to provide a Disability Certificate (as defined in Section 2.3 of this policy). 6.2.

To qualify for an accommodation, the student must provide a Disability Certificate (as defined in Section

--- PAGE 13 ---

12 I P a g e 2.3 of this policy). Alternate arrangements will be made with the view that stude nts are able to demonstrate their learning appropriately and suitably meet the criteria for progression or the conferment of an award. In general, standards for academic credit should not be modified. They may need accommodations in testing, but the conten t should not be changed unless necessary. Alternate arrangements for examination (for example, extra time, reduced distractions, use of assistive technology such as laptops, scribes etc.) must be approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5 in advance. Where needed, students with disabilities can choose whether or not to have their disability declared on their exam booklet so an external examiner is alerted to their disability. 6.3. Residential/on -campus housing related accommodations: The HEI wi ll ensure the provision of on -campus residential facilities/hostel to students with disabilities if they require it. In case of large universities with numerous hostel facilities, it is advised that special rooms be allocated to people with disabilities wi th washrooms, privacy and other necessary arrangements. 6.4.

Accommodations during convocation: The HEI shall make every effort to ensure that students with dis abilities are able to participate fully in their convocations and enjoy this day along with all their fellow graduates. 7. GRIEVANCES 7.1. Any grievances pertaining to disability services available at the HEI or any complaint by a student with disability concerning discrimination, abuse or mistreatment by another student, staff or faculty will be submitted to the Disability Coordinators. HEIs will ensure that students are aware of the process for filing a grievance. If they are unable to resolve the concern, the Accessibility Committee may be approached. The matter may be referred to the Vice Chancellor if the issue is not appropriately resolv ed by the Accessibility Committee. 7.2. If the grievance concerns a Disability Coordinator or a member of the Accessibility Committee, the complaint shall be received directly by the office of the Vice Chancellor/Rector, who shall

--- PAGE 14 ---

13 I P a g e replace the person aga inst whom the complaint has been made if substantial grounds for removal are established on grounds such as harassment, discrimination, indolence etc. 7.3. If any complaint made in accordance with Sections 7.1 and 7.2 has not adequately been addressed b y the office of the Vice Chancellor, the student may contact the HEC Disability Officer regarding the lack of compliance of the HEI with the provisions of this policy. 8. FUNDS TO SUPPORT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 8.1. The HEIs shall establish a spec ial fund to support students with disabilities and annually contribute sufficient funds therein through exclusive budgetary provision. Additionally, all funds and contributions raised through philanthropy shall accrue in this fund. Whenever the HEI or a st udent with disabilities’ own financial resources are deficient in meeting an accessibility requirement pertaining to his or her studies, the HEI will use this fund to provide the necessary accommodations after a thorough evaluation of each case. 9. RESP ONSIBILITIES OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION 9.1. The HEC will designate a Disability Officer who will provide guidance on the matters pertaining to this policy and facilitate vis -à-vis disability -related interactions with the HEIs.*** 9.2. The HEC may require the Disability Officer to assign weightage to the HEI’s c ompliance with this policy in the recurring grant formula, the ranking criteria and the Institutional Performance Evaluation (IPE). 9.3. Proposals for infrastructure development at HEIs may be submitted to the HEC’s Disability Officer and will be reviewed to ensure that any new building infrastructure comply with international accessibility codes for persons with disabilities. 9.4.

Upon approval of reports from AS & RB the Controller of Examinations shall intimate the supervisor and the Chairperson/In-charge/Principal/Director of the Department/College/Institute/School and supervisor shall address the issues and/or comments, if any. The supervisors shall certify that the comments/suggestions have been incorporated.
If the thesis is adjudged as adequate by all examiners, the candidate shall be required to undergo a public defense (videoconferencing with the HEC shall be used for the defense) and viva voce (oral examination) arranged and chaired by the Chairperson/Principal/Director. In general, the following minimum principles and guidelines shall be ensured:
Public Announcement: On the University website and other forums of communication, so that anyone interested can participate.
Public Access: Within or outside the University such as community/town halls or important public venues.
Neutral Chair: To ensure that defense was conducted fairly and in accordance with the rules and regulations.
Review Committee: To evaluate the dissertation and defense.
Question-and-Answer Session: There shall be a question-and-answer session to provide a basis for defense evaluation.
Final Decision to be expressed in the following terms:
Pass or
Pass with minor amendments or
Deferred for resubmission and re-defense or.
Fail (in exceptional circumstances and for the reasons to be recorded by the Defense Committee [Internal Supervisor, Examiner and concerned Chairperson / Principal / Director] )
A candidate who fails in public defense and/or viva voce examination in first attempt, s/he may sit for a second examination provided that the second examination shall not to be conducted earlier than three months from the date of the first examination. Failure on the second examination shall result in the dismissal from the candidacy.
Provided further that, the public defense and viva voce shall be conducted by examiners of whom one shall be the internal supervisor (co-supervisor in case supervisor is not available due to genuine reason and authorizes the co-supervisor in writing) and the other shall be the examiner(s).
After successful public defense and viva voce examination, the scholar shall submit Six/Seven hard bound copies of PhD thesis with black cover and silver ink to the following:
Chairperson/Principal/Director for departmental record
University Library
Controller of Examinations
HEC Record
Personal Record
If the examiners find that the thesis is wholly inadequate, they may recommend that it be rejected without any further test.
After successful public defense and viva voce examination, the Controller of Examination shall notify the result with the approval of the Vice Chancellor. However, degree shall be awarded like that of other degrees.
MS/MSc(Hons)/M.Phil/Equivalent or PhD Admissions based on Coursework Exemption

Writing Style
Your draft must be typed or printed on a computer.
Set the word processor to one and a half space (1.5 line space) and keep it there throughout the entire draft.*
Use 80 g white A4 (8.27” x 11.69”) paper. Set header and footer at 0.5” throughout your draft.
Use one inch margins on the left, right, top, and bottom of the page. These margins are wide in order to leave room for reviewer's comments.
Set the gutter position on the left of your whole document at .5”.
Use 12 points before and after paragraph spacing in which the first line of each paragraph is indented five characters for all paragraphs in the manuscript except the titles, table titles, notes, and figure captions.
For chapter titles, use 12 points before and 36 points after paragraph spacing, whereas in table titles, notes, and figure captions use normal paragraph (0 before and after paragraph spacing).
Use a 12 point font. In other words, there should be 10 typed characters per inch. The whole thesis should be typed in Times New Roman only.*
Single space after sentence terminators (i.e., '.', '?', '!').
Capitalize the first letter following a colon if the clause following the colon is a complete sentence.
Make sure the text is justified.
Use chapter separators. Each separator should have chapter titles in bold face, in a font size of 20 points, at the center of the page.
Writing in General
You must use complete sentences.
The first sentence of a paragraph must be independent (able to stand on its own). For example consider “While these studies are important, there is...” This sentence would be correct in the middle of a paragraph, but as the first sentence, it should more appropriately read, “While studies of the effects of whatever on whatever else are important, there is...”
Try not to use slang.
Do not use contractions. For instance, instead of it's, use it is.
If you are doubtful about the spelling of a word, do not guess. Look up the correct spelling in an appropriate
reference source
Proofread the copy that you submit and do correct minor typographical errors, formatting, spelling, or even the wording, with a pencil. These corrections are inevitable and will communicate that you are serious about your work.
Avoid excessive use of the terms I, me, and my, as well as the phrase personally speaking...
Avoid the use of sexist language. For example, consistently referring to a person as a him or he when it is just as likely for the person to be a she or a her, is sexist. However, using (s)he or him/her all of the time can also be awkward. If you phrase it right, you can often use the word person instead.
Avoid using 'empty words' or words which serve no purpose. For example, In the Smith (1990) study it was found that... should read more like Smith (1990) found that...
Generally speaking, use past tense in the abstract, introduction, and method. Results and discussion sections can be in the present tense.
Abbreviations
When abbreviating any terms, spell them out the first time (in both the abstract and again in the body of the manuscript, if need be). For example, The Sexual Opinion Survey (SOS) was used to...
Do not use too many abbreviations. Whereas one, two, or three can be helpful, four or five can be confusing.
You will often see the following Latin abbreviations used:
cf.
Compare
etc.
and so forth
e.g.,
for example
i.e.,
that is
et al.
and others
vs.
versus, against
Note that (except for et al.) these abbreviations are only used in parenthetic material. In non-parenthetic material, use the English translation.
Do not use E and S as abbreviations for experimenter and subject. This was done in articles written many years ago.
Note the period is not used with the following common abbreviations.
Centimeter
seconds
Milligrams
min
minutes
Grams
hours
Mean
intelligence
Numbers
The numbers zero through nine are spelled out (except when it is a table or figure number, or a metric measurement, etc.). The numbers 10 and above are written as numbers.
Capitalize nouns followed by numerals or letters that denote a specific place in a numbered series. For example, As can be seen in Figure 3, during Block 4 of Session 2 such and such occurred... Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2.
In the abstract, use digits for all numbers except when they begin a sentence. Note that this example demonstrates one of the exceptions to the rule noted in I.E.2.
Spell out any number when it is the first thing in a sentence. For example, the sentence “34 students were used”, is not appropriate and should read “Thirty-four students were used”.
Try to be consistent with number formats. That is, if you are reporting a series of related numbers, they should all be presented with the same number of decimal places. For an example, see I.D.5 above.
Report only two digits after the decimal point except when you are reporting the exact value of p, where three digits after the decimal point should be reported.
Do not use “0” prior to the decimal point in a coefficient (e.g., correlations coefficients, alpha coefficients etc.).
Citations in the Text
If you use someone's words or ideas, you must give them credit with a citation. This is particularly important, since the penalties for plagiarism are severe.
There are numerous ways to formally cite a reference in the text. Examples include Some fact (last name, year)., Last name (year) noted that..., or In <year>, <last name> reported that... For more ideas, pay close attention to the articles you read.
The first time the reference is cited in the text, spell out all of the authors’ last names. For example, Miller, Rosellini, and Seligman (1975) suggested that... With articles that have three or more authors use the Latin abbreviation for "and others" when the reference is cited a second (or third) time. For example, Miller et al. (1975) suggested that... or ... some fact (Miller et al., 1975).
If the citation is in parentheses and you need to use the word "and", use the ampersand ('&') instead. For example, Some (e.g., Estes & Skinner, 1940) have suggested that..., as compared to Estes and Skinner (1940) have suggested... Note also that the opposite applies as well, that is, if the citation is not in parentheses, you must use the word "and".
Multiple citations in parentheses are placed alphabetically and are separated by a semicolon and a space. For example, Some fact (Carlson, 1972; Moon, 1968; Partin, 1980).
If you cite something second hand, you must make it clear (e.g., Some fact (Smith, as cited in Jones, Year)). Note that in this example, only the Jones reference would be placed in the reference section.
Quotations
You must give page numbers for direct quotes. For example, Smith (1978) noted that "the world is round" (p. 1).
Three or four quotes in a 10 page paper is about the upper limit.
Display a quotation of more than 40 words as free-standing block of text indented 5 spaces from the left margin (doubles spaced as usual). Omit the quotation marks and include the page number in parentheses after the last period. Also, if the quotation is more than one paragraph, indent the first line of the second and any additional paragraphs 5 spaces.
Capitalization
Capitalize formal names of tests (Stroop Color-Word Interference Test).
Capitalize major words and all other words of four letters or more, in headings, titles, and subtitles outside reference lists, for example, "A Study of No-Win Strategies."
Capitalize names of conditions, groups, effects, and variables only when definite and specific. (Group A was the control group; an Age x Weight interaction showed lower weight with age.)
Do not capitalize names of laws, theories, and hypotheses (the law of effect).
Do not capitalize when referring to generalities (any department, any introductory course).
Commas
Do not use commas to separate parts of measurement (9 lbs 5 oz). Use the metric system, as a rule.
Use commas before "and" in lists, for example, height, width, and depth.
Use commas between groups of three digits, for example, 1,453.
Use commas to set off a reference in a parenthetical comment (Patrick, 1993).
Use commas for seriation within a paragraph or sentence. For example, "three choices are (a) true, (b) false, and (c) don't know." Use semicolons for seriation if there are commas within the items. For example, (a) here, in the middle of the item, there are commas; (b) here there are not; (c) so we use semicolons throughout.
Use commas in exact dates, for example, April 18, 1992 (but not in April 1992).
Italics & Underlining
Do not italicize or underline common foreign abbreviations (vice versa, et al., a priori).
Do not italicize or underline for mere emphasis.
Italicize or underline the titles of books and articles, species names, introduction of new terms and labels (the first time only), words and phrases used as linguistic examples, letters used as statistical symbols, and volume numbers in reference lists.
Miscellaneous: Colons, Dashes, Parentheses, Numbering Paragraphs
Do not use "and/or." Write things out. For example, "Monday, Tuesday, or both" is preferable to "Monday and/or Tuesday."
Do not use a colon or other punctuation after an introduction which is not a complete sentence such as this one, or any other sentence in the body of text which flows into an extended quote. The quote "picks up where the sentence leaves off" and provides the punctuation.
Use a dash (rendered on typewriters and some word processors as a double hyphen) when there is a sudden interruption like this one--zoiks!--in the flow of a sentence. Overuse "weakens the flow of the writing" (APA, 2001, p. 81).
Use parentheses to introduce an abbreviation, for example, the galvanic skin response (GSR).
Use appendixes (appendices) as the plural of appendix. Use datum as singular, data as plural. Use matrix as singular, matrices as plural. Phenomenon is the singular form of the plural phenomena. Use schema as singular, schemas (not schemata) as plural.
Headings
APA specifies 5 levels of headings.
Use level 1 heading (centered uppercase and lower case heading) for the subtitles of chapters.
Use flush left bold uppercase and lower case heading for sections of each chapter.
Use flush left bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subsections of a section.
Use indented bold and italicized uppercase and lower case heading for subheadings in each subsection.
Tables and Figures
Tables and figures should be able to stand alone (i.e., you should not have to read the manuscript to be able to understand a table or figure). A big help in this regard is the table title or the figure caption. Use these wisely to explain what is going on in the table or figure. In other words, do not be afraid to be a little bit verbose in your table titles and figure captions.
Tables and figures should not duplicate the same information. Likewise, you should not repeat the data point values in a table or figure in the text of the manuscript.
Tables and figures are most often used to present results, but may also be used to present other information, such as the design or a theoretical schema.
If you include a table or figure, you must introduce it in the text of the results section (e.g., Table 1 displays the...) and describe to the reader what should be seen in it.
Tables
Note that APA style tables do not contain any vertical lines, so do not draw them in or use your word processor to generate them.
Type the table number in bold face and then (on the next line) type the italicized table title flush left. Note that there are no periods used after the table number or title.
There are different ways to format tables. Your best bet is to set the tabs for the table or to use your word processor's table generating ability.
When using columns with decimal numbers, make the decimal points line up.
Line space within the tables should be set at 2 points (see Appendix B for sample tables).
Figures
'Figures' is the technical term for graphs, charts, drawings and pictures.
Figures (other than pictures) may be drawn in black and white only (using a ruler and preferably on graph paper) or they may be generated with a computer graphics program (keeping it in two dimensions).
Each figure should be followed by figure caption. The word 'figure' and the number are italicized, for example, Figure 1. The effects of...
Center each figure on the page vertically as well as horizontally and arrange for the figure to use the bulk of the page.
