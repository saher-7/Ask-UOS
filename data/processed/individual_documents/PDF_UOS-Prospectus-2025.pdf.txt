QUAID’S MESSAGE You know that the importance of education and the right type of education cannot be over- emphasized. Under foreign rule for over a century, in the very nature of things, I regret, suﬃcient attention has not been paid to the education of our people, and if we are to make any real, speedy and substantial progress, we must earnestly tackle this question and bring our educational policy and program on the lines suited to the genius of our people, consonant with our history and culture, and having regard to the modern conditions and vast developments that have taken place all over the world. There is no doubt that the future of our State will and must greatly depend upon the type of education and the way in which we bring up our children as the future servants of Pakistan. Education does not merely mean academic education, and even that appears to be of a very poor type. What we have to do is to mobilize our people and build up the character of our future generations. There is immediate and ur gent need for training our people in the scientiﬁc and technical education in order to build up future economic life, and we should see that our people undertake scientiﬁc commerce, trade and particularly, well planned industries. But do not for get that we have to compete with the world, which is moving very fast in this direction. In short, we have to build up the character of our future generations which means highest sense of honor, integrity, selﬂess service to the nation, and sense of responsibility, and we have to see that they are fully qualiﬁed or equipped to play their part in the various branches of economic life in a manner which will do honor to Pakistan. — Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's message at the First National Education Confer ence, Karachi, 27 Nov-1 Dec1947 4

he Faculty of Sciences is prominent among the Faculties of the University with the highly Ttrained and experienced faculty members and well equipped labor atories. Its achie vement in resear ch and patents are the fruit of consistent effor ts of teachers and students. The Faculty comprised of an institute and eight depar tments. The subjects of Botany and Zoology are enriched with innovative resear ch cultur e. Their faculty is well versed with practical application of modern techniques in biological sciences and their futur e potentialities in life sciences resear ch. Chemistr y tries to meet the ever-gr owing needs in the field of chemical sciences. The Earth Sciences has a progressiv e vision about explor ation of natur al resour ces, conser vation of envir onment and advanced geogr aphical information system. The faculty of Mathematics have potential to explor e latest advances in pure and applied mathematics from number theor y to data science and algebr aic geometr y to machine learning. Ther e are very productiv e groups in Pure, Applied and Computational Mathematics. Physics have well equipped state of the art labor atories such as X-ray crystallogr aphy, laser spectr oscopy, and thin layer deposition. Plasma physics, nanomaterials and DFT labor atories etc. Statistical designs and analysis experimental resear ch and surveys, embeds data insights for policy and decision making in every spher e of society and industr y. The faculty is continuously being upgr aded and strengthened by recruitment of quality graduates and upgr adation of labor atories and resear ch facilities. A number of multidisciplinar y resear ch projects in collabor ation with national and international institutes are in progress.FACULTY OF SCIENCES Institute of Chemistr y Biotechnology Botany Earth Sciences Mathematics Physics Statistics Zoology List of Institute/Depar tmentsPhone: 6O9 O48-923O811-15 Ext.
