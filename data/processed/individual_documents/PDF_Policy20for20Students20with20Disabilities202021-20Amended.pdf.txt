8 I P a g e c. In some cases, students with disabilities may be exempted from a part of an examination because of a disability. The HEI may decide to use an alternate assessment tool to ascertain suitability of the student for the degree program. This will be decided by the Academic Council of the HEI. d. Students with disabilities must be informed well in advance about the arrangements being provided for them to undertake the entrance exam. e. In case the entrance exam is administered by a third party, if the designated test administrator does not provide appropriate facilities for students with disabilities to suitably take the test, the HEI will arrange for an alternate entrance exam for students with disabilities. 4.3. Financial aid, quotas, and age relaxation requirements: People with disabilities may qualify for several benefits including those presented below: a. Students with disabilities may qualify for certain benefits under the provisions of the applicable disability laws of the jurisdiction in which they are located. The HEI shall ensure the provision of such benefits in accordance with relevant legislation.

9 I P a g e 5. PROCESS FOR REQUESTING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 5.1. The HEIs shall provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities whenever necessary to encourage their participation in higher education including in classrooms, libraries, laboratories, cafeterias and sports centers. The website of the HEI and other web - based services such as student portals, LMS etc. shall accordingly conform to level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 5.2. It is important to note that the duty of HEIs to provide support and necessary accommodations to students wit h disabilities is an anticipatory duty. In other words, the HEIs should have preparedness to offer reasonable accommodations to students and should not wait to initiate action until requested. 5.3. All students will be informed about options to request reasonable accommodations commensurate with their need during the orientation session. Students with disabilities will be offered an assessment of their study and support needs at the earliest opportunity, preferably before they enroll, or shortly after th e commencement of their program. As evidence of their disability for the purposes of this assessment, the Accessibility Committee may rely on a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner, documenting the disability and the need for any acco mmodations. 5.4. At the commencement of each course, staff * shall also clearly inform the students that any student who, because of a disability, may require special accommodations in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor o r the Disability Coordinators as soon as possible so that requisite arrangements can be made. Faculty are encouraged to use textbooks that are available in alternate format. It may not be necessary to rewrite a course to accommodate students with disabilit ies; simply modifying the presentation of materials may make it fully accessible. 5.5. It is important to note that in making its assessment, the Accessibility Committee will strive to understand and recommend reasonable accommodations specifically focusi ng on the needs of the individual student rather than recommending generic accommodations that may apply to a certain category a disability. Once an assessment has been conducted, the Accessibility Committee shall forward its directions to the relevant imp lementing authority, provided that in case of any accommodations that are directly related to examinations and assessments (i.e. listed under Section 6.2), approval of the competent authority designated by the HEI shall be required before implementation.

--- PAGE 11 ---

1O I P a g e 5.6. The views of the student with disabilities will be taken into consideration at all times during the assessment of their n eeds. The assessment report, containing detailed recommendations, will be shared with the student prior to its implementation. 5.7. Alternatively, the class instructor, the Disability Coordinators and the student may mutually discuss and decide on any s pecial requirements needed (including those needed for mid - term or final examinations) and accommodations at the start of the course and share them with the Accessibility Committee if its support is needed. 5.8. These accommodations may take considerab le time, and students should be informed of their course requirements, course components and reading materials well before the commencement of a course and on their accessibility requirements at the start of the course. 5.9. The Accessibility Committee will monitor the implementation of any accommodations deemed necessary and reasonable. 5.1O. The University will ensure the provision of the same level of services and support to students who acquire any disability (or become aware of their disability) during the course of their study. Every reasonable opportunity will be provided to them to compl ete their studies successfully. 5.11. Clause deleted**. 5.12. Faculty and staff should be aware of the use of accommodations and learning aides for students with disabilities. 5.13. HEIs shall have training programs to train faculty, staff, and memb ers of the accessibility committee on best practices for accommodating students with disabilities and especially encourage its staff, faculty, and students to participate in development opportunities related to the provision of education to persons with di sabilities. 5.14. Students with disabilities shall be encouraged to suggest improvements in accessibility and accommodation services available at the HEI. If one student with a particular type of disability had difficulty with a specific task, the faculty, the Accessibility Committee, and the Disability Coordinators may not assume that the next student with the same type of disability will experience similar problems. Students with disabilities are frequently sensitive about their disabilities, so faculty, the Disability Coo rdinators and staff should make every effort to treat these issues sensitively and confidentially.

11 I P a g e 6. TYPES OF ACCOMMODATIONS 6.1. Reasonable accommodations. In determining the accommodations to be provided, the Accessibility Committee shall make sure that these are reasonably tied to the nature and extent of the disability suffered.

Depending on the case, accommodations may include: a. medical and mental health assistance such as access to counselling; b. changes to physical infrastructure of HEIs including addition of footpaths, road crossings, sign age etc., provision of ramps or special pathways, wheel chairs, furniture, boards, dedicated washrooms and other basic facilities retrofitting in the existing buildings and to ensure the same in future construction; c.

In general, standards for academic credit should not be modified. They may need accommodations in testing, but the conten t should not be changed unless necessary. Alternate arrangements for examination (for example, extra time, reduced distractions, use of assistive technology such as laptops, scribes etc.) must be approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5 in advance.

GRIEVANCES 7.1. Any grievances pertaining to disability services available at the HEI or any complaint by a student with disability concerning discrimination, abuse or mistreatment by another student, staff or faculty will be submitted to the Disability Coordinators. HEIs will ensure that students are aware of the process for filing a grievance. If they are unable to resolve the concern, the Accessibility Committee may be approached. The matter may be referred to the Vice Chancellor if the issue is not appropriately resolv ed by the Accessibility Committee. 7.2. If the grievance concerns a Disability Coordinator or a member of the Accessibility Committee, the complaint shall be received directly by the office of the Vice Chancellor/Rector, who shall

--- PAGE 14 ---

13 I P a g e replace the person aga inst whom the complaint has been made if substantial grounds for removal are established on grounds such as harassment, discrimination, indolence etc. 7.3.

RESP ONSIBILITIES OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION 9.1. The HEC will designate a Disability Officer who will provide guidance on the matters pertaining to this policy and facilitate vis -à-vis disability -related interactions with the HEIs.*** 9.2.
